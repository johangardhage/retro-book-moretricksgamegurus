**1. Getting Started**
**==================**

**a. Story**
**--------**

        "I remembered something today. I haven't always been like this. Once, I
        was real. I don't remember anything else, but I just remember that
        there was an accident. I remember horrible pain, but I don't feel pain
        anymore, so that must mean something was different before that accident
        happened. I must have been born, just like the little children which we
        have compassion training with. We've had less compassion training
        lately. XRK-51 thinks we're going to fight soon, but I think it's just
        because the guards saw some incidents. They don't realize that we're
        usually nicer than they are, so they must have been shocked when they
        saw us sharing food. It doesn't matter, though. Compassion training is
        a nice break, but now I've got something more important to think about.
        What was I? Or maybe it was just a dream? I need to find out."

        That was your diary entry for July 17, 2132. You are XRK-52, a
        Battle-Oriented, Mechanically Advantaged Sentient, or BattleMech. You
        have no life before you woke up at the biological age of twenty. In the
        six years since then, you've been trained as a soldier. The things you
        wrote in your diary today gave you a new mission: you must get out of
        this prison, or training facility, as the people in charge call it,
        where you've lived all your life. You want to find out what you were
        and then...who knows? Somehow, you think that there's something better
        than rotting away here all of your life, preparing for the next war.

**b. System Requirements**
**----------------------**

        To run BattleMechs, you'll need the following system:
        *An IBM-compatible, 386 or better computer
        *Four Megabytes of RAM
        *A VGA monitor
        *Hard Disk with seven Megabytes free

        You'll have more fun with these recommended additions:
        *Pentium processor
        *Eight Megabytes of RAM
        *16-bit soundcard with wavetable synthesizer
        BattleMechs Supports the following sound cards
                *Gravis UltraSound
                *Sound Blaster (AWE32, 16, pro, and original, as well as
                compatibles)
                *Roland Sound Canvas and MT-32 (General MIDI)

**c. Installation and Setup**
**-------------------------**

        To get started with BattleMechs, do the following:
        1. Insert Disk 1 in your floppy disk drive
        2. Change to that drive and type: "INSTALL" and press Enter
        3. Follow the directions on-screen to install and configure BattleMechs
        for your computer. If you want to change the sound setup at a later
        time, run the program "SETUP" in the directory where you installed
        BattleMechs.

**d. Starting & Command Line Options**
**----------------------------------**

        To start the game, just change to the directory in which BattleMechs is
        installed, type "BM" and press Enter. There are several optional
        command line parameters which you can use by following "BM" on the
        command line with a space and as many of the following as you wish:
                "-NOSOUND" turns the sound off.
                "-MOUSE" will use the mouse to control the game.
                "-KEY" will use the keyboard to control the game.
                "-JOY" will use the joystick to control the game.
                "-INFO" will display additional troubleshooting information at
                the startup.

        Once you start the game with your parameters, the game will load, and
        you should see the opening screen. After a few seconds, the main menu
        will be displayed.

**e. Navigating the Menus**
**-----------------------**

        You can use the mouse, keyboard, or joystick to make a selection on the
        menus. Up and down will change the highlighted options, and Enter will
        change that option or bring up a sub-menu. Horizontal slider controls
        for the volume, brightness, and some other controls can be moved with
        the left and right controls. To start the game, just choose "New Game"
        from the main menu. Before doing this, however, you'll probably want to
        use the other menu options to configure the game to suit your computer.

**2. Controlling and Playing the Game**
**===================================**

        You can use the mouse, keyboard, or joystick to move yourself through
        the game. You can choose your input device from the main menu by
        choosing the "CONTROLS" option. This will also allow you to configure
        the keys and buttons to match your preferences. By default, the arrow
        keys or movement of the joystick and mouse will move your character,
        Space, the left mouse button, or joystick button one will shoot, and
        Alt, the right mouse button, or joystick button two will change
        weapons. You can bring up the map with Tab and the main menu with Esc.
        Doors will open automatically as you shoot them.

        BattleMechs have a surgically implanted computer which provides a
        variety of useful information. Messages from the computer are displayed
        on the top of your field of view. At the bottom is a display which
        tells you current ammunition amounts, weapons, health and armor damage,
        and items you are carrying. The computer also makes an automatic
        mapping of surrounding areas. Be sure to make use of the information
        the computer provides you with. 

**3. Tips for Beginners**
**=====================**

        *Watch the messages from the computer. It knows a certain amount of
        information about most of the things you'll encounter. You can ask it
        for additional information by pressing D for a detailed status report.

        *Don't fight everything you see. Some things and creatures may be
        helpful in your mission. If you're not sure, ask the computer.

        *Use the automatic mapper. You can mark spots on the map with M, so if
        you've found the exit door but don't have the key, or found food but
        have 100% health, you can come back later.

        *Keep an eye on your health. If it gets too low, make a trip back to
        one of the spots you marked.

**4. Network & Modem Play**
**=======================**

        You can play with up to seven other players with a network game, or one
        other person in a modem or serial link game. You can choose to play
        cooperatively, or to play without monsters against each other. To start
        a network or modem game, just choose "Network/Modem Play" from the main
        menu. You'll be asked to provide the information about the network or
        modem you're using, and then the multiple player game will be ready to
        start on a network or serial link. On the modem, you will be asked for
        the phone number, or to wait for a call. Once the connection is
        established, the game will be ready to start. You can start a game
        immediately, or press C to chat with the other players and verify that
        you're ready to play. At any time during the game, you can press M to
        send a message to the other players.

**5. Troubleshooting & Technical Support**
**======================================**

        If you have a problem, chances are you can fix it without needing to
        get help. Try the following:

        *Never run BattleMechs under Windows or any other multi-tasking
        environment. This can cause problems in running the program, and can
        also make it run much more slowly.

        *If the game says you have insufficient memory, or if it crashes, try
        rebooting without loading any TSR programs, such as your disk cache.

        *If you don't get any sound, make sure the mixer settings of your
        soundcard are set correctly.

        *If  the screen is to dark to see, try turning up the brightness on
        your monitor.

        *If you are unable to fix your problems, try calling technical support
        at 1-800-555-1212, or contacting us via electronic mail: tech@mega.com.
        Make sure you include your computer configuration and what you were
        trying to do when you encountered the problem. Also include any error
        messages that were displayed.
