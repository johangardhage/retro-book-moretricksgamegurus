                DiamondWare's Sound ToolKit

Welcome to DiamondWare's Sound ToolKit (STK).  If you're a game or
multimedia developer or programmer, and you want a hassle-free, easy
way to include high-quality music and digitized sound effects in
your products, and you don't want to pay high licensing fees or
ongoing royalties, you've come to the right place.

My name is Dave Snyder, and I'm the President of MVP Software.  I'd
like to tell you a little about this product and why we're so
excited about it.

Q: Why is MVP Software Publishing a Programmer's Toolkit?  I thought
you guys published games?

MVP is indeed a game publisher.  As such, we are always on the
lookout for ways to make our games better.  Frankly, until now we
had never found any sound drivers with which we were happy.
Although we've tried most of them, and used some of them, there were
always problems.

For one thing, I don't want our games littering users' hard drives
with zillions of tiny files.  For another, I want our games to work.
Period.  I want them to work with all the sound cards out there.  I
want our games to work on IRQs 2, 7, and 10, the notorious "problem"
IRQs.  I want the sound card setup to be completely transparent to
my users.  Many of our users don't even know what sound cards they
have installed in their systems, let alone what IRQ or DMA it's
installed on.  I want our sound drivers to handle all that stuff
reliably and automatically.

In addition, I want our games to sound great.  I want haunting
melodies, growling sound effects, and realistic reproduction.  I
don't want the sound drivers to take much memory, and I definitely
don't want them to sap speed from our games.  I want our DOS games
to work in a Windows or OS/2 DOS box.

One other thing.  I don't want MVP programmers to take all their
time learning how to use sound drivers.  I want the API to be clean
and the implementation as painless as possible.  And I want the
sound drivers to work fine in C/C++, Assembly, Pascal, and BASIC.

Q: It sounds like you want a miracle!

Yep, and that's why we're publishing DiamondWare's Sound ToolKit.
This product does all these things and more.  We've begun
implementing it in our games.  Already we have implemented it in
games written in C, Pascal, and BASIC.  We've conducted user beta
tests of these games.  In fact, we were so pleased with its
performance that we arranged to publish it and make it available to
other developers.

So if you want great sound in your games, you want easy
implementation, and you want to produce a game even a Kmart shopper
can install and use without calling tech support, give DiamondWare's
Sound Toolkit a run for its money.

Q: Can I try out DiamondWare's Sound ToolKit before I buy it?  I want
to see for myself that everything you say about it is true!

You bet.  That's why we have released this fully-functional demo.
You have everything you need right now to implement the STK in your
game or application and put it through its paces.  All the functions
and functionality is included in this demo.  We're so sure that
after you try this you'll want the full product, that we're not
hiding anything!  Heck, our docs even describe its limitations.

We only ask two things.  First, try the STK for 30 days.  If you
like it, buy the full DiamondWare's Sound ToolKit directly from MVP.
The price is only $299.95, and there are no additional fees or
royalties to pay.  You get unlimited technical support too.  Second,
tell your programmer friends about the STK and give them this demo.

Q: When I buy the full STK, what do I get?

Well, first of all, you get the complete product without those
beginning and ending sound effects that you hear in this demo.  We
know you're honest, but we weren't sure about everyone else. <g>
Seriously, this is a demo, not a free toolkit, and we put those
sound effects in there so everyone knows that right away.  So when
you purchase the full STK, you get a fully useable product.

Second, you get an excellent printed manual.  Our manual is the best
sound toolkit manual there is.  We've included full file
specifications on our .dwd and .dwm file formats.  We've even
included a chapter on aesthetic and design considerations of music
and sound in games, written by a published professional musician in
the field.

Third, you get an extra .ibk file.

Fourth, you get $287 of bundled software.  Yep, that's right, you
pay us $299.95 for the STK, and we include not only the STK drivers,
the docs, and the extra .ibk file, but we include $287 of additional
software.

Q: Cool!  What extra software do I get?

Well, if you're serious about music and sound effects in your
product, you'll need a FM editor and a digitized sound editor.
We've bundled two of the best with the STK, Flashpoint Production's
Symphonix OPL FM Patch Editor and Sonic Foundry's Sound Forge 2.0.
And these aren't shareware versions or demos, but full retail
products, including their own manuals.  Both are Windows programs,
and if you were to buy them separately (both are widely available),
you would spend $218.90 for the software.

But that's not all.  When you purchase the full STK, you also
receive a CD of 300 sound effects.  This CD has a list price of
$69.95.  The sound effects can be included in your game for no
additional licensing fees or royalties.  These are not public domain
or shareware sound effects, but professional files.

Q: OK, I'm convinced.  How do I order?

I thought you might ask that. <g>  From the United States or Canada,
call our 24-hour order hotline at 800-968-9684.  Have your Master
Card or Visa ready, and ask for DiamondWare's Sound ToolKit.  If you
prefer to email an order, send email to Dave Snyder on Compuserve at
74777,1116.  We'll need your name and address and credit card number
and expiration date to fill your order.  And please, the 800 number
is an order line only.  The folks who take your order barely know
how to use a computer, let alone answer technical questions.  If you
want support or have questions, call 616-245-8376.

Alternatively, print out the ORDER.FRM file included with this
demo version, fill it out, and mail it with a check to MVP Software,
1035 Dallas SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49507-1407.  Or fax it (don't forget
your credit card info) to 616-245-3204.

Overseas orders and support, call 616-245-8376.

                      All About the STK 

What Is It?  What Does It Do?
-----------------------------
DiamondWare's Sound ToolKit (STK) is a sound library written in 99%
real-mode assembler (except for API "wrapper" functions).  It
supports FM music synthesis and digital audio on Sound Blaster and
compatible hardware.

The STK can play up to sixteen digital effects at the same time
(called polyphony).  Unlike other sound libraries, there are no
restrictions on calling INT 21h (DOS) functions.

It's linkable with any C/C++, Pascal, or BASIC program, which means
adding the STK to a mostly-completed program will be easy.

The STK is built tough.  DiamondWare has acquired over thirty sound
boards, fifty books (including manufacturer's specifications), four
operating systems, and five brands of CPUs to test the STK during
development.  All this testing means that programmers who use the
STK won't field millions of tech-support calls saying "the sound
doesn't work," or "it doesn't crash unless I enable the sound
option."

The STK's autodetect is powerful.  It can determine the hardware
type, port, DMA channel, and IRQ level automatically--under every
major DOS environment (including Windows DOS boxes, OS/2 DOS boxes,
Novell DOS, QEMM, 386MAX, and EMM386), running on every major brand
of CPU, including Intel, AMD, Cyrix, IBM, and Texas Instruments.
The STK goes directly to the sound hardware, requiring neither
environment variables nor user input.  And, should you wish, you can
override any setting.

The STK provides "mixer" functionality.  The better boards (Sound
Blaster Pro and up) have chips on-board which can control the volume
level of music and sound effects independently, and also the total
volume.  For sound boards that don't have such a chip, the STK can
mix levels in software.

DiamondWare's STK supports an important subset of the MIDI
specification, including true dynamic patch changes, velocity
sensitivity, pitch bend, and aftertouch.  Future versions of the STK
will support more of the MIDI specification.

The STK doesn't allocate any memory dynamically.  It doesn't make
any INT 21h calls (except during autodetect and initialization).  It
doesn't require any outside code to link.  It doesn't have to
reprogram the timer hardware, though it comes with optional code to
do this.  The STK doesn't take hundreds of kilobytes of RAM.  It
doesn't pollute your users' install directories with scores of
files.  And it doesn't use a single line of code from a sound board
manufacturer, or any other library vendor.

What Are Its Limitations?
-------------------------
The STK is a kit for Sound Blasters, SB-compatibles, and SB-clones.
It will not work with the native modes of non-Creative Labs' sound

boards.  [Creative Labs is the major player in the sound board
market.]  However, it has been designed and tested to work with their
compatible modes, (which are often only 90-95% "compatible").

It requires a 386SX or higher processor .  This is not because it
uses so much computing power (it doesn't), but because we've made
extensive use of instructions and registers which are unavailable on
the 286 and lower.

The STK can't play VOC files (sound effects) greater than 64k,
although it supports easy sequencing of split-up VOC files.

The STK needs interrupts to remain active.  Disabling interrupts for
extended periods of time will pause all sound playback, until
interrupts are enabled again.  Music notes will hang, and digitized
will skip and repeat like a CD player trying to track a bad disc.

The STK does not support sampling rates under 4 KHz or over 24 KHz.

The STK does not manage resource files, nor play files from disk.
You must manage your directory structure, and load each file into a
buffer before the STK can play it.

The STK can't change its settings (like volume levels) "in the
background".  If you want to do this, then write some code that
checks the current time, and slowly change the volume level.  It's
no harder than moving 20 space aliens plus 1 player and 5 bullets.

                       Before You Start

Prerequisite Knowledge
----------------------
DiamondWare's STK is a programmer's library, not a game.  As such,
it's a highly technical product.  While this document was written to
tell you all about the STK, it can't tell you how to program.
Before reading this document, you should be familiar with PC
programming -- including bitwise operations and linking with external
libraries.

Prior PC programming experience in a language linkable with the STK,
including knowledge of bit-level operations, is presumed.

The STK was designed to work with C/C++, Pascal, and BASIC.  Even if
you will not be programming in C, several conventions and examples
in this manual are given only in C, so prior C experience will be
helpful.  For example, all function prototypes are given for C,
Pascal, and BASIC; but in general, descriptions are given only using
C terminology.  Here is a guide for Pascal and BASIC users to aid in
understanding C:

All subroutines are called "functions", although in Pascal and BASIC
they may be "functions", "procedures", or "subroutines".  A C
struct, often called a structure, is the equivalent of a Pascal
record and a BASIC TYPE.

C expresses bitwise OR as a pipe |, bitwise AND as an ampersand &,
logical OR as two pipes ||, and logical AND as two ampersands &&.  C
comments are either a double slash //Comment which is a comment

until the end of the line (equivalent to BASIC's apostrophe or REM)
or /*Comment*/ (equivalent to Pascal's (*Comment*)).  BASIC
programmers should ignore all underscores _.

There's one other important thing for Pascal and BASIC programmers
to know about C. The ampersand & operator can also be used to take
the address of a variable.  For example:

                dws_MSongStatus(&mstat);

This call passes the address of the variable mstat to the function
(which puts the song's status into the variable).  This is
equivalent to Pascal's var or BASIC's SEG (pass by reference)
calling conventions.

In specific instances, Pascal and BASIC differences with C will be
explicitly listed.

Sometimes in this document, Turbo Pascal is distinguished from other
languages.  This is because Pascal works with "units."  A unit
contains not only the linkable program code, but also the
declarations which tell the compiler about that program code and the
data types it requires.  C and BASIC use a different model, in which
the compiler is told to include some human-readable header file,
which contains declarations of code and data types, but no more.
The compiler produces a .OBJ file, which the linker puts together
with other .OBJ files (and .LIB files, which are really just several
.OBJ files in one) to make the final .EXE.

The Sound ToolKit is distributed with a single .LIB which works with
all Microsoft languages, Borland C/C++, and Turbo Assembler.  Header
files are provided for C/C++ and BASIC.  Also included are unit
files for Turbo Pascal versions 6 and 7.

All human-readable source files provided on disk were produced with
tab stops set to 2.

                       Installing the STK

The STK is distributed on a single disk containing two files:
INSTALL.COM and STK.EXE.  To install the STK simply insert the
distribution disk into drive A or B, and type A: or B:, and press
ENTER.  Then type INSTALL, and press ENTER.  The installation
program will create a directory and install the files to it.

That's it; it's installed.  If you have downloaded it, simply unzip
the zip file (using Pkunzip 2.04 or higher) into a directory on your
hard drive.

Make sure you put the header files and the library file (or the
Pascal unit file) where the compiler and linker can find them.  If
you need more information on this and related topics, your
compiler's manual will be far more detailed than is possible here,
and will cover your specific software environment.

You may want to put the executables (MID2DWM.EXE, VOC2DWD.EXE, etc.)
in an existing binaries directory, or set the PATH environment

variable to point to them.  Your MS-DOS manual describes this in
detail.

                    Linking With the STK

The STK has been designed so that calling it in a real-world program
is relatively simple.  However, the STK is a non-trivial component
of your program, and there are some non-obvious things to know.

As mentioned above, the STK works with C/C++, Pascal, and BASIC.
Additionally, it should work with any other linkable language which
supports the Intel/Microsoft .OBJ file format specification (such as
assembler).  If you are using such a language, you will have to port
the C header files to your language.  Link with DWS.LIB as you would
with any other library.

By far, the easiest way to use the STK is in large model programs.
In a large model program, all function calls and all data references
are made via 32-bit segment:offset addresses.  The STK expects this
convention.

It's possible to use the STK in mixed model programs, where some
code or data is "near" and other code or data is "far."  As long as
the STK's code and data is all "far," this can work.  See your
compiler manual for details on how to do this.

                    About Music and Sound

Introduction
------------
Sound, especially in the PC world, is a complicated topic.  This
section will serve as an overview of the subject.  The STK provides
functionality for the two primary aspects of sound programming: FM
synthesis for playback of MIDI (.MID format) music, and digital
audio for playback of digitally sampled (.VOC format) sound effects.

FM Synthesis
------------
FM stands for "Frequency Modulation," which refers to how musical
notes are created.  In FM, a sound is created from two operators,
which are simple sine waves.  One operator, called the modulator, is
used to modify the frequency output by the other, called the
carrier.  The resulting waveform is surprisingly rich (much more so
than Amplitude Modulation).  FM synthesis is a convenient method for
playing music.

The waveform is put through an envelope, which alters the output
volume during the four distinct phases of a musical note: attack,
sustain, release, and decay.

On Sound Blasters, FM synthesis is performed by a Yamaha OPL-2 or
OPL-3 chip in the digital domain.  The total output of all voices is
sent to a special Yamaha Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), which
creates low-level analog signals.

Programmed properly, the FM synthesizer can produce fairly nice
instrument sounds, including surprisingly good drums.  The key

phrase here is "fairly nice." If you want to create a mood, you can
do it with FM synthesis.  However, you cannot realistically
reproduce the sound of most acoustic instruments (FM does a better
job with "electronic" sounds).

Music is created by a musician, a computer, and sequencer software.
Usually he'll use a (music) keyboard controller to enter note data,
although some musicians may type it in on their computer's keyboard.

The result of the musician's toil and effort, the .MID file, is a
collection of note information, but it isn't sufficient to make
music; it contains no information about what the instruments should
sound like.  A patch bank, which is a set of instrument definitions,
fills this gap.  This nomenclature comes from the old days when
technicians plugged patch cords into racks of equipment to change
synthesizer sounds.  Today, patch is a synonym for a single musical
instrument sound.

The OPL FM chip uses eleven parameters to describe an instrument.  A
single instrument patch is therefore 11 bytes (plus a header and
some waste).  Software such as Symphonix OPL Patch Editor/Librarian
by Flashpoint Productions (included with the registered version of
the STK) is the best way to tinker with patches.

Collections of patches are stored in instrument bank files (.IBK
format).  Although you can put any instrument at any index in the
file, you're going to discover that only songs custom-written for
that instrument bank file will play correctly.  Other songs will
probably sound totally unacceptable.

Enter the General MIDI standard, which specifies all 128 patches
(e.g. instrument 1 is Grand Piano).  Although, for FM synthesis,
General MIDI compliance is not required, we strongly recommend it.
When the industry moves to wavetable boards, your music will sound
good on most boards.  (Eventually, all sound hardware will support
General MIDI and wavetable.  But today's installed base is about 99%
FM and 1% wavetable.  Sales of FM hardware are still much higher
than wavetable.  Wavetable sales are projected to surpass FM sales
in 1996.  Wavetable installations will surpass FM no earlier than
1997.  Considering this, and the fact that many wavetable boards
also include or emulate FM, we believe FM is far more important than
wavetable right now.  Good FM is currently a big market advantage.)

Digital Audio
-------------
In digital audio, an analog waveform is translated into the digital
domain by sampling (i.e. measuring) the amplitude of the wave at
regular intervals.  The sampling rate is the frequency at which this
is done.

As Nyquist proved, the sampling rate must be at least twice as high
as the highest frequency in the waveform being sampled, or else
aliasing occurs.  When this happens, the sound takes on an
unpleasant metallic overtone.

Let's say you're recording the sound of glass breaking, which

includes some very high frequencies -- we'll assume up to about 11
KHz.  Unless you're using a low-pass analog filter (the Sound
Blasters have several) to cut out high frequencies, you should
sample at 22 KHz or higher.

Note: sampling at very low rates will have undesirable side-effects.
Speech will be lisped, and in general, everything will sound dull.

Dynamic range, which is the difference between the softest and
loudest sounds, is also important.  16-bit samples sound better than
8-bit samples because the extra byte allows more precision, and more
contrast between soft and loud.

It is important to record your sound effects at a low volume, if you
plan on playing more than one or two simultaneously.  You can also
compress the dynamic range when you prepare the sound.  This will
help you avoid clipping (i.e. exceeding the dynamic range of the
playback hardware).

                       General Guidelines

Don't Touch That Compiler Yet!
------------------------------
Before you can bring sound into your program, you must convert the
.MID and .VOC files into formats that are quickly and easily parsed
at run-time.  Use MID2DWM and VOC2DWD, respectively.  See the
Utilities heading in the Reference section for more information on
how to use these programs.

The Autodetect
--------------
Before you can initialize the STK, you must know the sound hardware
settings: base port, DMA channel, and IRQ level.  You can ask the
user, you can parse the BLASTER environment variable, or you can use
the STK's autodetect.  The last is the recommended method.

Using the autodetect is easy.  Create two structs, one of type
dws_DETECTOVERRIDES, and the other of type dws_DETECTRESULTS.  Set
the baseport, digdma, and digirq fields of the overrides struct to
65535 (to autodetect them), or initialize them with their correct
values.  Either way, call dws_DetectHardware, passing the address of
both structs as parameters.  The results struct will be filled in.

Note: you must call dws_DetectHardware even if you know these values
in advance.  The reason is that it stores information in the
reserved field.

Note: If you write the settings to a disk file (not recommended),
make sure you write the entire struct.  dws_Init requires the
information in the reserved field and may crash if it's not there.

For more information about these and other structures, see Data
Structures in the Reference section.

Many sound boards require the user to load drivers from either
CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT (e.g. the Advanced Gravis Ultrasound and
SBOS) These drivers must be loaded before any STK-enabled software

is run.  If the driver isn't loaded, some boards may not respond, or
worse yet, could take on default values which conflict with other
hardware.  This last case is a major potential problem and could
cause a crash.

In the overwhelming majority of cases, the autodetect will quietly
do its job.  It is robust, and there are only two known (obscure)
failure cases.  If you find any others, please report them to
DiamondWare!

The first failure case occurs only when the STK is running in a
Microsoft Windows Enhanced-mode DOS box.  If the user has another
card which is constantly doing DMA on an 8-bit channel, the STK will
crash the machine.  The only card known to do this is the NE2100 bus
mastering ethernet adapter, which uses a 16-bit DMA channel 99% of
the time.  (It's an expensive, high-performance card; running it on
an 8-bit DMA channel is like putting 85-octane gas into a sports
car.)  Other devices that use DMA, like CD-ROM and SCSI controllers,
do not perform DMA transfers unless they are in use, and will not
cause any problems with the STK.

The second failure case occurs only with Aria 16 and Aria 16se
cards.  If the Sound Blaster portion of the board is configured for
IRQ 2/9, the autodetect will incorrectly return the IRQ used by the
MIDI portion of the board, rather than that of the digitized
portion.

Initializing the STK
--------------------
After calling dws_DetectHardware, you'll need a struct of type
dws_IDEAL.  Its fields are requests for STK services.  Set each to
the desired values.  Then call dws_Init, passing the address of the
dws_DETECTRESULTS and dws_IDEAL structs as parameters.

This struct is here for three reasons.  The first is to tell the STK
the initial sampling rate you want.  The second reason is to
conserve CPU cycles.  The STK will run faster with fewer digital
voices.  The last reason is that future versions of the STK will
offer more features (e.g. 16-bit, stereo, etc.)  You may not want
some or all of these services.  Initialize this struct properly, and
you will easily incorporate STK upgrades into your programs.

When the STK initializes, it resets the sound hardware to a 100%
known state, including setting the mixer to maximum volume.  It also
sets up its own internal data structures, Interrupt Service Routines
(ISRs), etc.  Few STK functions will work until you call dws_Init.

The Hardware Timer
------------------
Next, initialize the hardware timer.  The STK must be called at a
relatively high rate.  The DiamondWare Timer (DWT) module will do
the trick, or you can use your own code.

If you're going to use the DWT, call dwt_Init, passing it a rate
constant as a parameter.  The DWT will do all timing functions
necessary to the STK (and keep time for your game, too).  See
dwt_Init in the Function Reference for complete information.

If you have your own code, initialize it now.  Make sure it will
call dws_Update once during each hardware timer interrupt.  The DWT
will not interfere, or even link into your application.

Initiating Playback
-------------------
To play a song, first allocate a buffer large enough to hold the
.DWM file, and then read it in.  Create a struct of type dws_MPlay;
set the track field to point to this buffer, and the count field to
the number of times to play.  Now call dws_Mplay.  The song will
play in the background.

To play a sound effect, allocate a buffer, and read in the .DWD
file.  Create a struct of type dws_DPlay; set the snd field to point
to the buffer, the count field to the number of times to play,
ignore priority field (for now), and set the presnd field to 0 (for
now).  Now call dws_DPlay.  The sound will play in the background.

For more information on these structs and calls, see the Advanced
Tutorial section, or The Functions heading and The Data Structures
heading in the Reference section.

Note to BASIC users: make sure that your buffers don't move around
during "garbage collection".

The Rules of the Game
---------------------
The STK can play one music track, and up to sixteen sound effects
(at the same sampling rate) at the same time.  Once a song or sound
is playing, you can let it play without doing anything else.  You
can even make DOS calls.

In the mode used by the STK, the FM chip allows up to 6 musical
instruments and 5 drums to play simultaneously.  Drums can play and
replay, still sounding good, but it's important that your music
sound (and/or sustain) no more than 6 melody notes at a time.  The
STK player will automatically drop notes out (though it won't
crash), but a musician would inevitably make a better decision as to
which notes are important than any computer algorithm.

There are five drums built in to the STK, chosen as a reasonable
compromise: bass drum, snare, high hat, tom tom, and top cymbal.
All other drums are mapped to these five.

The STK will refuse to exceed the dynamic range of the hardware it's
playing on.  This means that if you try to play 4 sound effects
which all use the full 8 bits of dynamic range, you'll only hear the
one with the highest priority.  Until it ends, the others will not
be played, although they will continue to advance silently.  If the
sound with the highest priority ends, any remaining sounds are added
back in, to the limit of the dynamic range of the playback hardware.

Playback Status
---------------
The functions dws_MSongStatus and dws_DSoundStatus determine whether
a song or sound is playing or finished.  Each of these functions
requires you to create a status variable for them to use.  To get

the status of your music, pass the address of the status variable to
dws_MSongStatus.  To query the status of a specific sound effect,
pass the address of the status variable, as well as its ID (from the
soundnum field of its dws_DPLAY structure) to dws_DSoundStatus.

Each bit of the status variable is a flag.  Perform a bitwise and
between the status variable and the playback condition you would
like to test.  For example, dws_MSONGSTATUSPLAYING & status
evaluates to a 1 if the music is still playing, and
dws_DSOUNDSTATUSPLAYING & status evaluates to a 1 if the sound
effect is still playing.  For a complete list of conditions, refer
to both routines in the The Functions heading in the Reference
section.

Keeping Time
------------
The DWT provides a double-word (32 bit, unsigned) timer, which
begins at 0 when DWT is initialized, and increments once per timer
interrupt.  Calling dwt_MasterTick returns the number of clock ticks
since time began (i.e.  when you called dwt_Init).  dwt_Pause and
dwt_UnPause suspend and restart the master clock, respectively.
They don't affect either music or digitized sound playback.

Tracking Errors
---------------
Most functions in the STK return a word (16-bit, unsigned) value.
This is a boolean value, indicating the success/failure of the
function.  True (1) is success, and false (0) means that an error
has occured.  In the case of an error, call dws_ErrNo to determine
what happened.

dws_ErrNo behaves much like the errno variable in the C standard
library.  Initially it's 0, and it's only changed when a function
encounters an error.  It's important to check it after each call
which fails, or else you won't know which one generated the error.
Under The Functions, in the Reference section, there is a list of
errors for each function.  You may assume this list is exhaustive;
if an error isn't listed for a given function, then that function
cannot generate that error.

Stopping Playback
-----------------
Call dws_MPause or dws_MUnPause to suspend or restart music
playback.  Call dws_MClear to stop the current song.  Make sure you
stop music playback before you deallocate the song buffer, or you
may get some noise.

Call dws_DPause or dws_DUnPause to suspend or restart all digitized
sound playback.  Call dws_DClear to stop all currently-playing
sounds.  Call dws_DDiscard to stop a particular sound from playing;
this function requires the sound's ID as a parameter (from the
soundnum field of its dws_DPLAY structure).  Call dws_DDiscardAO to
stop all occurrences of a digitized sound; this function requires a
pointer to the sound's buffer.

Shutting Down
-------------
Before exiting to DOS, you must clean up.  First, call dwt_Kill (or
shut down your own timer module).  Next, call dws_Kill.  Finally,
deallocate any buffers you may have allocated during execution.

There is a problem in Microsoft Windows Enhanced-mode DOS boxes when
the sound board is set to IRQ 2/9, and Windows isn't configured for
the sound board.  The first time an STK-using program runs in this
environment, it will work perfectly.  But if the user exits the
STK-using program, and restarts it before restarting Windows, there
will be no digitized sound (FM music will play normally).

                          Tutorial 

This tutorial will walk you through MINAPP.C, an application
framework which fulfills the minimum requirements for implementing
the STK in a program.  It is intended for learning the basics; it
does not check for STK errors at all.  The source code for the
sample applications PLAYDWD, PLAYDWM, and FINDSB are provided in C,
Pascal, and BASIC on disk.  They include (more) robust
error-checking, and are highly commented.  Please review them as
well.

Setting Up:  Includes and Variables
-----------------------------------
#include <<stdio.h>>
#include <<malloc.h>>
#include "dws.h"
#include "dwt.h"

void main (void)
{
    FILE *fp;
    byte __far *sound, *song;
    word mstatus, dstatus, msize, dsize;
    dws_DETECTOVERRIDES dov;
    dws_DETECTRESULTS   dres;
    dws_IDEAL ideal;
    dws_MPLAY mplay;
    dws_DPLAY dplay;

The standard C header file stdio.h is included for the file I/O
functions, and malloc.h to support dynamic memory allocation.  dws.h
contains all the STK prototypes, #defines, structures, and type
definitions.  dwt.h provides the same, for the DWT.

MINAPP loads one sound effect, and one piece of music.  sound, a
pointer, holds the address of the sound effect buffer; song, another
pointer, holds the address of the music buffer.  dplay, a struct,
holds all information needed to play the sound effect; mplay,
another struct, holds information for playing the song.  dov, dres,
and ideal are structs required for initialization.

Loading Songs and Sounds
------------------------
/* ALLOCATE MEMORY FOR SOUND FILE AND LOAD IT */
    fp = fopen("minapp.dwd", "rb");
    fseek (fp, 0L, SEEK_END);
    sound = _fmalloc (dsize=ftell (fp));
    fseek (fp, 0L, SEEK_SET);
    fread (sound, dsize, 1, fp);
    fclose (fp);

/* ALLOCATE MEMORY FOR SONG FILE AND LOAD IT */
    fp = fopen("minapp.dwm", "rb");
    fseek (fp, 0L, SEEK_END);
    song = _fmalloc (msize=ftell (fp));
    fseek (fp, 0L, SEEK_SET);
    fread (song, msize, 1, fp);
    fclose (fp);

These two sections allocate buffers to store the music and the
sound, then read the files into them.  minapp.dwm began life as
minapp.MID and gm.ibk, and was converted by MID2DWM.  minapp.dwd
began as MINAPP.VOC, and was converted by VOC2DWD.

Initializing the STK
--------------------
/* AUTODETECT SOUND CARD */
    dov.baseport = 65535;
    dov.digdma   = 65535;
    dov.digirq   = 65535;
    dws_DetectHardWare (&dov, &dres);

/* INITIALIZE DIAMONDWARE STK SYSTEM */
    ideal.musictyp   = 1;
    ideal.digtyp     = 8;
    ideal.digrate    = 10989;
    ideal.dignvoices = 16;
    ideal.dignchan   = 1;
    dws_Init (&dres, &ideal);

Notice how all fields in the struct, dov, are set to 65535.  This
tells dws_DetectHardWare to autodetect the corresponding sound
hardware parameters.  The results of this are returned in the dres
struct.  We initialized the ideal struct to request the desired STK
services (in this case overkill, since we only need one digitized
voice).  When we call dws_Init, the sound hardware and the STK are
set up for business.

Optional Timer Module
---------------------
/* INITIALIZE OPTIONAL TIMER MODULE */
    dwt_Init (dwt_72_8HZ);

A PC bootstraps (starts up) with a rate of 18.2 clock ticks per
second, but the STK requires a higher rate.  Just as importantly,
the STK must be called during each clock tick.  The DiamondWare
Timer module will do this.  We recommend 72.8 Hz, a good compromise
between music quality and Windows DOS-box compatibility.  (If you

don't care about Windows DOS boxes, use 145.6 Hz.)

Preparing Songs and Sounds
--------------------------
/* PREPARE SONG FOR PLAYING */
    mplay.track = song;
    mplay.count = 1;

/* PREPARE SOUND FOR PLAYING */
    dplay.snd      = sound;
    dplay.count    = 1;
    dplay.priority = 1000;
    dplay.presnd   = 0;
    dws_DGetRateFromDWD (dplay.snd, &ideal.digrate);
    dws_DSetRate (ideal.digrate);

The mplay struct is set up so that a call to dws_MPlay will play the
song once.  The dplay struct is also set up.  A priority of 1000 is
arbitrarily chosen, but since no other sound effects will be playing
in MINAPP, this field has no practical effect.  The presnd field is
also unused (set to 0), because this example does not sequence
digital sounds.  The current playback rate is set to the sampling
rate at which the sound was recorded.

Initiating Playback
-------------------
/* PLAY SONG AND SOUND ONCE */
    dws_MPlay (&mplay);
    dws_DPlay (&dplay);

A call to dws_MPlay starts the music, and a call to dws_DPlay begins
playback of the digitized sound effect.

Wait 'Til the Fat Lady Sings
----------------------------
/* MAIN LOOP */
    do
    {
        dws_DSoundStatus(dplay.soundnum, &dstatus);
        dws_MSongStatus(&mstatus);
    }
    while ((mstatus & dws_MSONGSTATUSPLAYING) ||
              (dstatus & dws_DSOUNDSTATUSPLAYING));

We query the song and sound status.  The status is placed in a
bitfield variable, via its address.  In the case of the music, we're
interested in the dws_MSONGSTATUSPLAYING field; in the case of the
digitized sound effect, we're interested in the
dws_DSOUNDSTATUSPLAYING.  When this field is 1, it means that the
song or sound, respectively, is playing.

Shutting Down
-------------
/* CLEAR ALL ALLOCATED MEMORY */
    _ffree (song);
    _ffree (sound);

/* DE-INITIALIZE STK */
    dwt_Kill();
    dws_Kill();
}

The buffers containing the music and sound effect are now
deallocated.  Normally, dws_DClear and dws_MClear would be called
before freeing these buffers, but since we know that no sounds are
playing at the moment, the calls are unnecessary.  The DWT is
de-initialized first by calling dwt_Kill, then the entire STK engine
is shut down by calling dws_Kill.  That's it!

                        Advanced Tutorial 

Working with the Advanced Features
----------------------------------
The example code fragments below illustrate sequencing and polyphony. We 
assume that the STK has been initialized.  sfx1 and sfx2 are digital sounds in
memory.  The following shows how the two dws_DPLAY structures are set up:

        dplay1.snd      = sfx1;
        dplay2.snd      = sfx2;
        dplay1.count    = 1;
        dplay2.count    = 1;
        dplay1.priority = 500;
        dplay2.priority = 1000;
        dplay1.presnd   = 0;
        dplay2.presnd   = 0;

Each sound effect is set to play once, and the second sound is given
a higher priority than the first.  The presnd field of both structs
is not set for sequencing.

Sequencing
----------
The presnd field allows you to sequence sounds to play one after the
other.  The first sample of the second sound plays after the last
sample of the first sound.  The effect is that of a single sound,
playing seamlessly.

This feature is useful if you want to break a long sound into
several pieces which can fit into memory.  Or a sound may have
several different continuations, depending on player input (e.g.  a
gun fires, continuing with either a scream or a ricochet, depending
on whether the bullet hits).

Set the presnd field of a dplay struct to the soundnum of the sound
you want to sequence after, or use 0 if the sound is stand-alone.

Note: if you specify a non-zero sound number (which corresponds to a
sound actually playing), the value returned in soundnum is the same
as the value specified in presnd.  The new sound will not play
immediately, but will wait until the first sound is done.

The priority field is not related to sequencing.

    dws_DPlay (&dplay1);
    dplay2.presnd = dplay1.soundnum;
    dws_DPlay (&dplay2);

This plays dplay1 followed by dplay2.  If you are sequencing more
than two sounds, call dws_DSoundStatus to determine when it's safe
to sequence each sound after the second.

Polyphony
---------
To play multiple digital sounds, call dws_DPlay more than once.

The presnd field has no bearing on polyphony.

    dws_DPlay (&dplay1);
    dws_DPlay (&dplay2);

The sounds start simultaneously.  dplay1, the first sound, has a
priority of 500.  dplay2 has a priority of 1000.

These numbers are arbitrary; it is the relationship between them
that counts.  Priorities of 1 and 2 will have the same results.

Note: if these two sounds together do not exceed the dynamic range
of the hardware, they'll both play.  However, if the total dynamic
range used by both sounds exceeds 8 bits, then you will hear only
the second sound (its priority is higher).  If the second sound is
shorter, then the first sound will be heard when the second one
ends.  Until then, it will advance silently.

                          Reference

This section of the manual is broken down into several headings: The
Functions, The Errors, The Data Structures, The Utilities, and The
File Formats.

                        The Functions

Preamble
--------
There are two headers provided with the STK.  The first is for the
sound library (DWS.H for C and DWS.BI for BASIC), and the other for
the DiamondWare Timer module (DWT.H for C and DWT.BI for BASIC).

For Turbo Pascal version 6 and 7, there are two .TPU files provided.
Additionally, although it's not strictly necessary, DWS.PAS (which
also contains the timer module) is provided so you can see how
everything is declared.  The sound library header declares the
constants for each error the STK can generate, some bit field
constants, the data structures used by the STK, and the prototypes
of the functions.

This is a complete list, in alphabetical order, of functions
provided by the STK and the optional timer module.  Each function
will be listed with a general description, as well as the
declaration syntax (prototype) for C, Pascal, and BASIC (in that
order), parameters, return value, possible error conditions, and
related functions.

Most STK functions have a boolean return value to indicate success
(true), or error (false).  If an error occurs, call dws_ErrNo to
determine what happened.  Unless otherwise noted, the STK will
perform no action during any call which returns an error, including
modifiying structs -- all return values are undefined.

Most errors are provided to help you integrate the STK into your
application; once your program is stable, you should not expect to
see any errors occur.

All functions and all pointers are far.  All functions use the
Pascal calling convention.

The Optional Timer Module
-------------------------
If you have written your own hardware timer code which reprograms
the timer rate, then you don't need the DWT.  Simply don't call our
module, and it won't link into your application.

The DWT reprograms the hardware timer to run at a much faster rate
than normal, while keeping the DOS and BIOS clocks happy by calling
them at 18.2 Hz (like they expect).  The DWT makes the call to
dws_Update, which is required to keep the STK happy.  And DWT will
also keep time in a way useful for video games and multimedia
applications.  Even if the user has no sound hardware installed, you
can still use DWT for its timing functions without any ill effect.

    If you attempt to discard a sound which is not currently
    playing, this function will return success.

    Parameters
	
    sndnum is the sound you wish to discard, from the sound's

    function dws_DDiscardAO(snd : dws_BTPTR) : word;
    DECLARE FUNCTION dwsDDiscardAO% ALIAS
        "DWS_DDISCARDAO" (BYVAL snd&)

    Description
	
    This function discards all occurrences of one sound effect (.DWD
    file) that is currently playing.  If you are playing the same
    sound effect several times, this is an easy way to stop them
    all -- useful before you deallocate the sound's memory buffer,
    for example.

    This function requires that you specify the sound by the address
    of its buffer in memory.

    Note: if any sound killed by this function has a sequenced sound
    waiting to play after it, the sequenced sound will be killed
    also.

    Parameters
	
    snd is a pointer to the buffer storing the .DWD sound effect.

    Return value

    Boolean success.

    dwsDetectHardWare% ALIAS "DWS_DETECTHARDWARE" (SEG dov AS
        dwsDETECTOVERRIDES, SEG dr AS dwsDETECTRESULTS)

    Description

    This is the STK's hardware autodetect.  It detects card
    settings, or verifies settings you put in dov.  Upon return, dr
    will be filled with the autodetection results.  DiamondWare
    recommends calling this function at the beginning of your
    program, each time it is run, so that if the user changes
    hardware settings between runs, your program will still work.

    Parameters

    dov is a pointer to a dws_DETECTOVERRIDES struct.  Set every
    field with either a 65535 (to autodetect), or an override (user
    setting).  User setting values will be accepted on faith (sort of).

    dr is a pointer to a dws_DETECTRESULTS structure, where the
    function will return its results.

    The reserved array in this struct holds important information;
    if you write the contents of the struct out to a file, write the
    entire struct!  dws_Init requires all of this information;
    without it, the STK could crash the computer.

    The bitfield capability indicates supported features:  

    0                                       //no sound hardware
    dws_capability_FM                       //music
    dws_capability_DIG                      //digitized sounds
    dws_capability_FM | dws_capability_DIG  //Both

    Return value

    Boolean success.

    Description

    This function sets the digitized sampling rate.  If sounds are
    currently playing, this might sound weird.

    Note: some sound boards don't support every rate allowed by the
    Sound Blasters.  Many sound boards will produce an audible click
    when the rate is changed on the fly.

    The STK supports sampling rates from 4 KHz to 24 KHz.

    Parameters

    frequency is the new sampling rate to use.

    DECLARE FUNCTION dwsDSoundStatus% ALIAS "DWS_DSOUNDSTATUS"(BYVAL
        sndnum%, SEG result%)

    Description

    Internally, the STK stores each sound in a slot.  Each slot can
    hold up to two sounds -- an active sound and a sequenced sound
    (which becomes active when the currently active sound ends).
    The slot is identified by the ID of the sound playing in it.

    This function queries the status of a slot.

    Parameters
	
    sndnum is the sound's unique ID.

    result is a pointer to a variable to hold the returned status: 

    0                                         //no sound with this ID
    dws_DSTATUSCURRENT                        //sound is currently playing
    dws_DSTATUSSEQUENCED                      //sound is sequenced
    dws_DSTATUSCURRENT | dws_DSTATUSSEQUENCED //both

    For a slot to contain a sequenced sound, it must also hold a
    playing sound.  If you ever encounter a case where a slot
    contains only a sequenced sound, please report it to
    DiamondWare.

    Return value

    Boolean success.

        FUNCTION
    dwsInit% ALIAS "DWS_INIT" (SEG dr AS dwsDETECTRESULTS, SEG ideal
        AS dwsIDEAL)

    Description

    This function configures and initializes the hardware and the
    STK internals.  Most STK calls won't work until after this call.

    The exceptions are dws_Update, dws_DetectHardware, dws_ErrNo,
    and dws_DGetRateFromDWD.

    Parameters
	
    dr is a pointer to a dws_DETECTRESULTS struct that has been
    filled in by a call to dws_DetectHardware.

    ideal is a pointer to a dws_IDEAL structure, which you must fill
    in with your requested settings.  The programmer might not want
    the user's sound board running to its limit, and/or the user's
    sound board may not support every feature of the STK.

    Note: the STK supports sample rates from 4 KHz to 24 KHz.

    Return value
	
    Boolean success.

    Description

    This function closes down the STK.  You must call it before your
    program terminates.

    Note: make sure you cover every exit path from your program,
    including DOS critical errors!  Failure to do so will leave the
    machine in a bad state.  The sound board will make noise
    forever.  The DMA controller will continue transferring.  The
    sound hardware will continue to generate IRQ's.  When the next
    program is loaded, it will overwrite the STK's Interrupt Service
    Routine (ISR)--and the machine will crash.

    Parameters

    None.

    Return value
	
    Boolean success.

    dws_Init, dws_DetectHardware, dws_Update

    Errors

    dws_NOTINITTED, dws_Kill_CANTUNHOOKISR

    If the STK can't unhook its ISR, it probably means the user
    installed a TSR which handles the sound board's IRQ.  Whatever
    it accomplished(?), it's now preventing the STK from properly
    unhooking itself.  Tell the user to get rid of it, and call
    dws_Kill again.

                               The Errors

About the Error Listing
-----------------------
This section discusses every possible STK error in numerical order.
See The Functions to find the complete list of errors which may be
flagged by any given function.

0.  dws_EZERO
There was no error.  You didn't need to call dws_ErrNo.

1.  dws_NOTINITTED
The STK was not initialized when you called an STK function.

2.  dws_ALREADYINITTED
This call cannot be made after the STK is initialized.

3.  dws_NOTSUPPORTED
The installed hardware doesn't support the requested feature (music
or sound).

4. dws_DetectHardware_UNSTABLESYSTEM
This system is now unstable.  Please report this to DiamondWare.

5. dws_DetectHardware_BADBASEPORT
6. dws_DetectHardware_BADDMA
7. dws_DetectHardware_BADIRQ
You tried to override the autodetect with an irrational value for
base port, DMA channel, or IRQ level, respectively.

8.  dws_Kill_CANTUNHOOKISR
After the STK initialized, the user installed a TSR which hooked the
sound board's interrupt vector.  The STK can't shut down cleanly.
Tell the user to kill the TSR.  Then call dws_Kill again.

9.  dws_X_BADINPUT
You attempted to set a mixer level (digitized, music, or master) to
a value outside the range 0-255.

10.  dws_D_NOTADWD
The buffer does not contain a valid .DWD file.

11.  dws_D_NOTSUPPORTEDVER
This .DWD file is the wrong version.  Please reconvert using the
VOC2DWD which came with this version of the STK.

12.  dws_D_INTERNALERROR
The STK encountered an invalid internal state.  Please report this
to DiamondWare.

13.  dws_DPlay_NOSPACEFORSOUND
You attempted to play a low-priority sound, but all slots were in
use.  Try increasing ideal.dignvoices.  If this error occurs with
that set to 16, you're playing too many sounds too fast.  Note: this
one is a warning.  It's reasonable to flag this error occasionally.
But if it occurs immediately, or consistently, try calling dws_DPlay
less often.

14.   dws_DSetRate_FREQTOLOW
15. dws_DSetRate_FREQTOHIGH
You attempted to set the sampling rate to an invalid frequency.  The
STK supports sampling rates from 4 KHz to 24 KHz.

16.  dws_MPlay_NOTADWM
The buffer does not contain a valid .DWM file.

17.  dws_MPlay_NOTSUPPORTEDVER
This .DWM file is the wrong version.  Please reconvert using the
MID2DWM which came with this version of the STK.

18.  dws_MPlay_INTERNALERROR
The STK encountered an invalid internal state.  Please report this
to DiamondWare.

                        The Data Structures

Preamble
--------
In this section, the data structures are laid out in table form.
This is done in the hope that it's easier to read than compiler
declarations.  Obviously, you can read the actual source files if
you wish.

Note to Pascal programmers: the following types were created to
allow the declaration of subroutines which take far pointers to
their parameters.  Declaring a function:

function FooBar(var x: word);

passes a near pointer.  The STK expects far pointers.

dws_DOPTR = ^dws_DETECTOVERRIDES;
dws_DRPTR = ^dws_DETECTRESULTS;
dws_IDPTR = ^dws_IDEAL;

                         The Utilities

PLAYDWM
-------
PLAYDWM is a simple program to play .DWM music files.  Full source
is included with the STK.  Usage is:

PLAYDWM songname.dwm

You must type the full filename, including the .DWM.

PLAYDWD
-------
PLAYDWD is a simple program to play .DWD sound effect files.  Full
source is included with the STK.  Usage is:

PLAYDWD soundfx.dwd

You must type the full filename, including the .DWD.

FINDSB
------
FINDSB is provided as both a simple example of how to use the STK,
and as a useful program in its own right.  Full source is included
with the STK.  It will find and print out the user's sound board
settings.  Usage is:

     FINDSB

MID2DWM
-------
MID2DWM converts type 1 standard MIDI files from .MID format to .DWM
format.  It is strictly a command-line utility.  Usage is:

MID2DWM <<rate>> <<midifile>>[.MID] <<instrfile>>[.IBK] [outfile
[.DWM]]

rate is the frequency, at which STK will get its "heartbeat" call
during run-time.  In general, the higher the rate, the more natural
the music will sound (to a limit).  If your music was performed by a
human, there are many nuances of timing which will be lost at lower
rates.

Note: if your program is running in a Windows DOS box, 145.6 Hz will
not work correctly (Windows will simply refuse to call you that
fast, and so the music will play slower than normal).

The STK includes an optional timer module which is capable of four
rates: 18.2, 36.4, 72.8, and 145.6 Hz.  If you use your own timer
code, then tell MID2DWM the rate it runs at; MID2DWM will work at
any rate.  If you're using the code supplied in the STK, use one of
those four rates only.

midifile is the name of the source file for the music, in MIDI type
1 format.  The extension, .MID, is optional.

instrfile is the name of the instrument patch bank file, in .IBK
format.  The extension, .IBK, is optional.

outfile is an optional parameter, to specify the name of the output
file (if different from the source file).  The extension, .DWM, is
optional.

As a simple matter of managing the hundreds of files in your
project, if you keep the default file extensions for each type of
file, you'll make your life easier.

Examples:

C:\SOURCE\BANE\MUSIC mid2dwm 72.8 death gmptch
C:\SOURCE\BANE\MUSIC mid2dwm 36.4 death.mid gmptch.ibk dth1.dwm

MID2DWM can convert, and the STK can play, music files larger than
64K.

VOC2DWD
-------
VOC2DWD converts digitized sound files from .VOC format to .DWD
format.  It is strictly a command-line utility.  Usage is:

VOC2DWD <<vocfile>>[.VOC] [outfile [.DWD]]

vocfile is the filename of the input file, which must be in VOC
format.  The extension, .VOC, is optional.

outfile is an optional parameter which specifies the name of the
output file, if different from the input file.  The .DWD extension
is optional.

Examples:

C:\SOURCE\BANE\SFX voc2dwd scream
C:\SOURCE\BANE\SFX voc2dwd scream.voc sc1.dwd

You can use DOS wildcards to specify vocfile, as in:

C:\SOURCE\BANE\SFX voc2dwd *.voc

VOC2DWD will allow you to convert files greater than 64K; however,
this version of the STK will not play them back.  A sequencing
mechanism is offered to allow you to play long sounds, but they must
be broken up while they're in .VOC format.

Although .VOC files can support all sampling rates via "extended
blocks", some .VOC editors only save standard blocks.  These blocks
round to the nearest encodable rate, which can be off by up to 1
KHz.  For example, an 11 KHz .VOC file will be saved at 10989 Hz if
the sound editor only supports standard blocks.  A difference of 11
Hz is negligible to the human ear, but 1000 Hz (which happens at
higher rates) is not.  VOC2DWD supports both kinds of blocks, and
reports the true sampling rate during the conversion to help combat
this problem.
