Notes
-----

The bulk of this file is error checking logic.

However, this code isn't really robust when it comes to standard error checking
and particularly recovery, software engineering technique, etc.  A buffer
is statically allocated.	A better technique would be to use fstat() or stat()
to determine the file's size then malloc(size).  The STK will handle songs
larger than 64K (but not digitized sounds).  Obviously, you'd need to fread()
such a file in chunks, or write some sort of hfread() (huge fread).  Also,
exitting and cleanup is not handled robustly in this code.	The code below can
only be validated by extremely careful scrutiny to make sure each case is
handled properly.  A better method would the use of C's atexit function.

But all such code would make this example file less clear; its purpose was
to illustrate how to call the STK, not how to write QA-proof software.
