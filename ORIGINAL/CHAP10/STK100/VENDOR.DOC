             support easily and quickly to your games or multimedia
             applications. Clear API and lucid docs make implementation a
             snap. Works with C/C++, Pascal, BASIC and ASM. Used in many
             professional games, now available to the public. No royalties
             required. Written in 99% hand-optimized ASM for speed and rugged
             reliability.

Catalog vendors: Please include DiamondWare's Sound ToolKit in your printed and 
                 disk shareware catalogs.  For best sales results use one of the 
                 above descriptions.  In addition, all MVP product listings MUST
                 include the words "by MVP Software" or "an MVP Software
                 production."  This encourages repeat sales, which is good for
                 both of us.  The only exception to this is if the catalog has
                 a separate MVP Software section.  No vendor may charge a fee
                 of more than $8.00 for the shareware version of this product.
                 Vendors are encouraged to contact MVP Software directly to get
                 the latest version of the product and to be added to our
                 mailing list for direct mailings of updates & future releases.

Rackware vendors and CD-ROM publishers: Please read our rackware and CD-ROM
                                        distribution policy below.

MVP Word Search for Windows may be distributed via BBSs, shareware printed or

          RACKWARE VENDORS AND CD-ROM PUBLISHERS AND RESELLERS

MVP Software has a policy on shareware rack vending and CD-ROM distribution
to which all CD-ROM publishers and vendors selling our shareware in a retail
location MUST adhere.  No MVP Software shareware product may be sold on
shareware racks in any retail location or on any CD-ROM without prior written
approval from MVP Software.  This policy affects DiamondWare's Sound ToolKit, 
plus all other MVP products.  Thanks for your understanding.

All MVP shareware products may be sold via catalogs, mail order, telephone
orders, flea markets, computer clubs, and any other method that does not
involve sales in retail locations or on CD-ROMs.

Authorization to distribute MVP Software shareware products on a CD-ROM or in
a retail setting will be handled on a case by case basis.  Publishers and
distributors MUST contact MVP Software for written authorization before
including DiamondWare's Sound ToolKit on a CD-ROM or selling it in a retail
setting.

And just to be clear: the above requirements do NOT apply to catalog sales.
